# Retail-Store-Sales-Prediction-with-Streamlit-

Producing an accurate sales forecast is vital to business success. Public companies can quickly lose credibility if they miss a forecast. Machine learning is said to be one of the most accurate ways to forecast sales. In this article, I am going to demonstrate how I used Streamlit to deploy my already built machine learning model. A link to the source code of the built model will be available in this article.

## Processes taken in building my Streamlit app

1. Exporting Machine Learning(ML) items
2. Setting up environment
3. Importing Machine Learning items from local PC
4. Building the app Interface
5. Setting up the backend to process inputs and display outputs
6. Deployment
